# Project Patriot Nexus: AI-Enhanced Multi-Vector Threat Intelligence Platform

**GMU Patriots Defending Cyberspace with GPT-4 Powered Analysis**

## Team Information
- **Team Lead**: Kevin Landry
- **Team Members**: Abdul, Emmanuel, Roshan
- **Course**: AIT670 - Cloud Security M.S.
- **Instructor**: Professor Tanque
- **Institution**: George Mason University

## Executive Summary

We're building "PatriotPot Deception Framework" - a next-level AI-powered honeypot network that doesn't just catch attackers, it learns from them. This isn't your typical honeypot setup. We're integrating GPT-4 for real-time threat analysis while keeping the AI restricted to SOC/IR guidance so the team gets hands-on CLI experience.

**Project Duration**: 8-10 weeks  
**Team Size**: 4 members  
**Budget**: $50/month maximum (including AI costs)

## What Makes This Different
