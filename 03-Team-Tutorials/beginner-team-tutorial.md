# Team Access Tutorial: GMU Honeypot EC2 Instance
**Complete Beginner's Guide - No Linux Experience Required**

## What You'll Learn
- How to connect to our cloud server (EC2 instance)
- Basic commands to monitor our honeypot
- How to work as a team on this project

## Step 1: Install WSL2 (Linux on Windows)

**What is WSL?** It's a way to run Linux commands on Windows.

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Press `Windows key + X`
   - Click "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)"
   - Click "Yes" when prompted

2. **Install WSL:**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
   - Wait for installation to complete
   - **Restart your computer** when prompted

3. **After restart:**
   - WSL will automatically open
   - Create a username and password (remember these!)

## Step 2: Install VS Code (if you don't have it)

1. Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install with default settings
3. Open VS Code
4. Install the "Remote - WSL" extension:
   - Click Extensions icon (4 squares) on left sidebar
   - Search "Remote WSL"
   - Click "Install" on the Microsoft one

## Step 3: Open WSL in VS Code

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`**
3. **Type:** `WSL: Connect to WSL`
4. **Press Enter**
5. **A new VS Code window opens** - this is connected to Linux!

## Step 4: Get the SSH Key File

**I will send you a file called `gmu-honeypot-key.pem`**

1. **Save it to your Downloads folder**
2. **In VS Code WSL terminal** (bottom panel), type:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.ssh
   ```
   - This creates a hidden folder for security keys

3. **Copy the key file:**
   ```bash
   cp /mnt/c/Users/YourWindowsUsername/Downloads/gmu-honeypot-key.pem ~/.ssh/
   ```
   - Replace `YourWindowsUsername` with your actual Windows username
   - **Example:** `cp /mnt/c/Users/John/Downloads/gmu-honeypot-key.pem ~/.ssh/`

4. **Set correct permissions** (important for security):
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem
   ```

## Step 5: Test Connection to Our Server

**Type this command exactly:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem ec2-user@44.222.200.1
```

**What this means:**
- `ssh` = connect to another computer
- `-i ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem` = use this key file
- `ec2-user` = username on the server
- `44.222.200.1` = our server's address

**If successful, you'll see:**
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-21-182 ~]$
```
**Congratulations! You're now connected to our cloud server!**

## Step 6: Make Connection Easier

**Instead of typing that long command every time, let's create a shortcut:**

1. **Type:** `nano ~/.bashrc`
   - This opens a text editor

2. **Use arrow keys to go to the bottom**

3. **Add this line:**
   ```bash
   alias ec2='ssh -i ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem ec2-user@44.222.200.1'
   ```

4. **Save and exit:**
   - Press `Ctrl + X`
   - Press `Y` (yes to save)
   - Press `Enter`

5. **Activate the shortcut:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

**Now you can connect with just:**
```bash
ec2
```

## Basic Linux Commands You'll Need

**Navigation:**
```bash
pwd                    # Shows current folder location
ls                     # Lists files in current folder
ls -la                 # Lists all files with details
cd /path/to/folder     # Changes to a folder
cd ~                   # Goes to your home folder
```

**Viewing Files:**
```bash
cat filename.txt       # Shows entire file content
head filename.txt      # Shows first 10 lines
tail filename.txt      # Shows last 10 lines
tail -f filename.txt   # Shows last lines and keeps updating
```

**Basic Operations:**
```bash
sudo command           # Runs command as administrator
exit                   # Disconnects from server
clear                  # Clears the screen
```

## Honeypot Commands (Copy & Paste These)

**Check if honeypot is running:**
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 2222
```
- If you see output, it's running
- If no output, it's stopped

**View live honeypot activity:**
```bash
sudo tail -f /opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log
```
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop viewing

**Test the honeypot (open a second terminal):**
```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@44.222.200.1
```
- This connects to our fake server
- Try commands like `ls`, `whoami`, `cat /etc/passwd`
- Type `exit` to disconnect

**Start/Stop honeypot (coordinate with team first!):**
```bash
# Stop honeypot
sudo -u cowrie python3.10 /opt/cowrie/src/cowrie/scripts/cowrie.py stop

# Start honeypot
sudo -u cowrie python3.10 /opt/cowrie/src/cowrie/scripts/cowrie.py start
```

## Understanding the Terminal Prompt

When you see:
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-21-182 ~]$
```

This means:
- `ec2-user` = your username
- `ip-172-31-21-182` = server name
- `~` = you're in your home folder
- `$` = ready for your command

## Common Beginner Mistakes

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Make sure you typed the command exactly
- Check that the key file has correct permissions: `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem`

**"Connection refused" error:**
- The server might be stopped
- Contact team leader

**"No such file or directory":**
- Check your spelling
- Make sure you're in the right folder with `pwd`

**Stuck in a command:**
- Press `Ctrl + C` to cancel
- Press `Ctrl + D` to exit

## Team Coordination Rules

1. **Always announce in team chat before:**
   - Stopping the honeypot
   - Making configuration changes
   - Running tests that might affect others

2. **Share interesting findings:**
   - Screenshot unusual log entries
   - Document attack patterns you notice

3. **Don't panic if something breaks:**
   - Take a screenshot of the error
   - Ask for help in team chat
   - Don't try to "fix" things you don't understand

## Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Take a screenshot of your terminal
2. Copy the exact error message
3. Ask in team chat with context: "I was trying to [do what] and got this error: [paste error]"

**Useful keyboard shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl + C` = Cancel current command
- `Ctrl + D` = Exit/logout
- `Ctrl + L` = Clear screen (same as `clear`)
- `Up arrow` = Previous command
- `Tab` = Auto-complete file/folder names

## Project Overview

**What we're doing:**
- Running a "honeypot" - a fake server that attracts hackers
- Monitoring who tries to break in and what they do
- Analyzing attack patterns for our cybersecurity project

**Your role:**
- Help monitor the honeypot
- Document interesting attacks
- Learn about cybersecurity through hands-on experience

**Remember:** This is a learning environment. It's okay to make mistakes - that's how we learn!
